			<h2>Wastes</h2>
			<h3>Forest, Plains, Extreme Hills</h3>
			<p>
				The wastes are what makes up most of the world; bleak, barren zones
				inhabitated by only few mutated animals and hardy shrubs,
				but roamed by hordes of Orbital Industries robots, gangs of Bandits
				and packs of Lost.
				Almost all traces of human civilization are gone, only the abandoned
				H.I.V.E’s and scrap shack villages remain,
				silent reminders of the failure of the once great human society.
				The H.I.V.E’s were constructed by O.I. before the war as subterran
				networks, linking several cocoon bunkers together into a superstructure.
				They can be found nearly everywhere and still contain valuable resources
				and machinery like batteries or gears, for those who dare to explore them.
				The scrap shack settlements were created by those unlucky human scavengers
				who would eventually become the Lost. Denied access to the H.I.V.E’s,
				they would created makeshift huts on stilts above the ground as
				protective meassure. However the elevated position couldn’t protect
				them against the radiation which slowly turned the unlucky survivors
				into barley human beings, driven only by their instincts.
			</p><hr>

			<h2>Snow</h2>
			<h3>Tundra, Taiga</h3>
			<p>
				The only regions left mostly unaltered in wake of the Event,
				the atomic holocaust and the nuclear winter were those uninviting
				areas that were extremly cold to begin with e.g. high mountains and
				tundras.
				When the nuclear fallout fell down in form of radiating snow flakes it
				wouldn’t penetrate the thick layers of snow,
				ice and frozen ground, leaving the groundwater and plant seeds, burried
				underneath the permafrost, unpoisoned.
				After the climate had stabilzed itself somewhat and nature returned to
				its usual cycle of snowmelt and snowfall,
				the fallout had already lost most of its hazard potential and the flora,
				foremost spruce trees, recovered.
				The fauna wasn’t so lucky however. Most animals suffered severe mutations
				or died by radiation, malnourishment or cold.
				Only the wolf-dog hybrids managed to adapt in large packs, hunting down
				the last living creatures in the harsh wilderness.
			</p><hr>

			<h2>Desert</h2>
			<h3>Desert</h3>
			<p>
				The Event and the following environmental catastrophes caused lots of
				already arid areas to dry out completely.
				Orbital Industries used these areas as disposal zones for their clean-up
				operation after the Event,
				storing the sometimes radioactive debris of destroyed cities either deep
				underground or in barrels throughout the deserts.
				The irradiated Moon dust that fell from the skies in large quantities was
				dropped on dumps,
				increasing the uninhabitable desert character of those areas even more.
				All that remains from this enormous effort are the drilled shafts,
				sometimes burried in the sand,
				sometimes flooded and the piles of green barrels scattered around,
				humming quietly with residual radiation.
			</p><hr>
			
			<h2>Antenna facility</h2>
			<h3>Jungle</h3>
			<p>
				Before Orbital Industries’ Moon landing in 8 BE, fission and fussion
				materials on Earth were starting to dwindle.
				In an effort to keep their own growing industries supplied with cheap
				electricity, O.I. set out to find alternative engergies.
				They came to the only logical conclusion: Giant lightning absorbing tesla
				towers!
				Humongous Facilities covering whole tracts of land, featuring giant copper
				coils tipped with lightning rods were erected to attract, harvest, store
				and process lightnings. Each lightning strike would generate whopping
				1,21 GW equaling the total energy output of a small plutonium fission rod,
				while the frequency of giant thunderstorms near the “Antennas” (as this
				was their official designation) was abnormally high.
				The ozone created by the lightnings would also be collected by small,
				expanding canisters attached to the rods and processed into N2O which
				in turn could be used in the creation of medicines and stimulants.
				The Antennas featured a to date revolutionary system for their
				construction.
				A group of AITBs (Antenna in the box) would be deployed in an open space.
				Either through natural sources like light and lightings,
				or (as it was more often the case) through artificial electricity input
				those engineering marvels would collect energy.
				When the critical energy level was met, they would spontaneously convert
				the stored electricity into matter and “grow” within a few seconds. If a
				group of AITBs was put close together they would bond and generate a much
				bigger antenna. (The “In the box” system would be used after the Event
				by the Lost for the quick construction of their shacks, before they
				became the braindead monstrosities that they are today)
				Of course the discovery of huge Helium – 3 deposits on the Moon rendered
				the expensive power plants obsolete, a fact that Mr. History was aware
				of and therefore “forgot” to mention until he had netted contracts for
				the construction of thousands of Antennas around the world.
				Once again he got away with it, by offering to upgrade the Antennas
				into weather control devices, radar scramblers,
				tesla anti-air and anti-ground weapons or all of those options
				combined…against a fee of course.
				After the Event, the upgraded antennas were used to counteract the
				drastic climate changes, but to no avail. During the war they were used
				as weapons, with devastating effects, but unable to stop the deployment
				of nuclear weaponary.
				After the period of bloodshed the former power plants began to decay,
				turning into giant expanses of rubble,
				home to a lot of stray cats leading their pitiful lifes underneath the
				still intact antennas.
			</p><hr>

			<h2>Swamp</h2>
			<h3>Swamp</h3>
			<p>
				Lots of areas hit by freak thunderstorms or tsunamis during the Event
				and the war never recovered. The terrain was eroded by the forces of
				nature and he deluges of water carrying nuclear fallout were unable to
				drain off fast enough before the fine mud clogged the ground. Vast
				expanses of flat, radioactive, stagnant water were the result, void
				of all life.
				Years afterwards when the water masses started to receed pioneer species
				like fungi and vines had returned to the small islands wihin the
				brackish morass but still tons of fish would die, victims to radiation
				trapped in the water.
			</p><hr>

			<h2>Funga-plast Island</h2>
			<h3>Mushroom Fields</h3>
			<p>
				Only months before the Event,
				Orbital Industries started to cover some isolated islands with an
				experimental plating against nuclear radiation called Funga-plast.
				This carefulness was due to the the remarkable and a slightly
				uncontrollable properties of the new shielding material: It was
				self-reparing and replicating.
				Somewhat similar to fungal mycelium,it would absorb minerals and
				moisture from the ground and form a thick, ground covering,
				crystalline structure resembling metal sheets. While dense enough to
				be stepped on and able to absorb incoming radiation of various magnitudes,
				the Funga-plast was no where near as durable as any actual metal.

				O.I.’s foresight to limit their initial deployment of Funga-plast payed
				off, as side effects became known:
				Other spore based life forms, mostly mushrooms and fungi, settled within
				the nutrient rich confines of the Funga-plast, turning the radiation
				shield into a breeding ground. The massive amount of spores that lingerd
				in the air clogged the respiratory systems of any living being, and the
				cooling units of all robots, in the area.
				Another side effect was that the Funga-plast would fuse with the
				fruiting bodies of various fungi, using them as a medium to grow into
				absurd pseudo-metallic platforms resembling the former mushrooms
				For those reasons O.I. deemed the radiation shield project a failure
				and abandoned the almost lifeless islands.
				Unbeknownst to them, a strand of stonebacks would manage to withstand
				the constant spore exposure, albeit even more mutated and as a living
				host to mold and mushrooms.
			</p><hr>
				
			<h2>Wastelands</h2>
			<h3>Mesa, Mesa Bryce, Mesa Plateau, Mesa Plateau M</h3>
			<p>
				These areas used to be giant cities with buildings everywhere. But
				after the event, the buildings were destroyed and various furniture were
				scattered. The result is large mountains of junk and debris.
			</p><hr>
			
			<h2>Radio Antenna Fields</h2>
			<h3>Savanna, Savanna M</h3>
			<p>
				Unlike the large antenna facilities used to generate power, these
				large fields were used to transmit radio waves to far away areas.
				Of course, after the event, the sattelites were knocked down, making
				these antennas useless. Now, The Masked has moved in to these areas
				as the large flat areas has made it suitable for small scrap shack
				villages.
			</p><hr>
			
			<h2>Spruce Forests</h2>
			<h3>Mega Taiga, Mega Spruce Taiga</h3>
			<p>
				When the event happened, it started huge forest fires that seem to
				go on forever. One might assume that this left the area uninhabitable.
				Instead, the fire made the ground more fertile,not only allowing trees
				to grow in abundance, but also allowing to grow extremely tall!
			</p><hr>
			
			<h2>Solar Energy Collection Fields</h2>
			<h3>Sunflower Plains</h3>
			<p>
				When fission and fusion materials became scarce, O.I set out to
				find alternative energies this part is actually canon. One of the few
				alternative energies were solar energy. O.I set up S.E.C (Solar Energy
				Collector) at certain areas to collect this type of energy. Alas, this
				type of energy has been proven to be ineffective as the energy collected
				wasn't enough to power an entire nation. The project was abandoned soon
				after in favor of the large antenna facilities.
			</p><hr>
			
			<h2>Layered Automated Defense System (LADS)</h2>
			<h3>Clay Mesa</h3>
			<p>
				As hostilities began among the remaining, struggling post-Event nations,
				it seemed obvious that their existing defense mechanisms would have to
				be upgraded. In light of this, the quarreling states came up with a plan.
				Their plan was simple, although incredibly expensive in terms of
				resources: significant cities would be totally covered with colossal
				arrays of defense systems and various fortifications. The resources
				were gathered and the plan was carried out more or less successfully,
				but the engineers responsible for the project failed to note one
				important weakness: the electronics and fortifications chosen could,
				if sufficiently weakened, allow critical levels of radiation through
				at certain points. Once people began inexplicably dying and this
				weakness became all too clear, the surviving authorities agreed to
				demolish the subterranean cities in order to expand the H.I.V.E.
				project, in hopes of a more effective shelter.
			</p><hr>
			
			<h2>Military Antenna Shack Settlement</h2>
			<h3>Savanna</h3>
			<p>
				In the late stages of the war, desperate military authorities began
				an ambitious project with the goal of creating a possible haven for
				soldiers and military forces. Engineers reverse-engineered the lightning
				conducting antennas of OI's tesla towers more or less successfully.
				The aim of using antennas was to facilitate long-range communication
				between divisions by transmitting messages using the stilt. Sadly,
				these poorly conceived structures were almost as transparent to
				radiation as their scrap-shack predecessors, slowly killing off the
				remaining military forces and plunging H.I.V.E.-dwelling postwar
				survivors into a state of total anarchy.
			</p><hr>
			
			<h2>Dense Scrap Shack Town</h2>
			<h3>Roofed Forest</h3>
			<p>
				Towns and cities too large to be fully accommodated by a simple
				Scrap Shack Village, but too small to warrant construction of a
				Layered Automated Defense System, generally set up a large number
				of upgraded Scrap Shacks, Barrage Umbrellas, to house their inhabitants.
				Because these municipalities
				were more wealthy than their smaller counterparts, they invested in
				slightly modified fungal radiation shields to help protect their
				denizens. In at least one way, this plan worked: the inhabitants
				generally were exposed to less radiation than those in the scrap-shack
				villages and, as a result, generally either survived to become Bandits
				or mutated into the Lost rather than dying. These communities also
				obtained robots for labor and defense, but their circuitry underwent
				many of the same malfunctions as those in the wastes, meaning they are
				now just as hostile as their former owners. Also, huge metallic
				mushrooms grow there, due to large amounts of metal found in the soil.
			</p><hr>
			
			<h2>Moon</h2>
			<h3>Nether</h3>
			<p>
				Once the beautiful and sole satellite of Earth, the Moon is a literal
				debris field in the orbit nowadays.
				After Orbital Industries’ mining operations and underground weapon
				testing started to hollow it out, the Moon soon became nicknamed
				“The Belly”.
				During the Event an experimental Moon portal sucked a fraction of
				Earths atmoshpere into the Belly and set of a chain reaction of
				explosions. The Moon broke appart.
				The atmosphere on the Moon allows the transmission of soundwaves but
				isn’t thick enough to sustain life (expect the Moonshroom).
				After the scientists that survived the Event in the Belly were stranded
				(as O.I. was disbanded and the nuclear war broke out) their sanity and
				bodies were twisted by their hazardous environment. The lack of
				maintenance threw mining and security robots into a state of disarray,
				making the Moon one of the most dangerous places to be. Even if you have
				a space suit on you to prevent suffocation.

			<h2>Realm of Madness</h2>
			<h3>The End</h3>
				<span class="cite">
				<p>From: █████████</p>
				<p>To: ████████████</p>
				<p>Subject: Disappearance of ███ ██████ and possible connection to
				Dr ██████████████████</p>

				<p>The theory I introduced in my report 10 hours ago seems to be accurate.
				Our agent “Creeper” has located the source of the mysterious portal
				signatures and found evidence of a massive illegal H.I.V.E close
				to ██████ between ██████ and █████████ on the coordinates ████████.
				According to his findings it’s financed by Croc.Co.
				Furthermore “Creeper” has witnessed the incoming of three armored
				transport trucks with ventilation slots, which hints towards living cargo.
				The number plates were ██████, ██████ and ██████ and turned out to be
				registered for a letterbox company in █████████.
				All this seems to proof that to Dr ██████████████████ is experimenting
				on humans.</p>

				<p>The Orbital Industries employee we took in two days ago disclosed
				that ███ ██████ had initiated a company-internal inquiry against to
				Dr ██████████████████ because he suspected him off unethical work
				methods. This led to to Dr ██████████████████’s departure.
				The entire affair was preceded by a dispute between ███ ██████ and to
				Dr ██████████████████ because of a denied experimental cyborg procedure
				to revive the latters wife.
				The employee went on and reported that during his work under to
				Dr ██████████████████ he has had access to experiment files that
				described a being similar to the unidentified assailants that
				destroyed the Orbital Industries office building in ████████, by
				mysteriously appearing inside and removing its foundation.</p>

				<p>The interrogation of to Dr ██████████████████’s cleaning woman was
				largely inconclusive, exept for the fact that to Dr ██████████████████
				became reclusive after the death of his wife and developed a strange
				fixation on penguins.</p>


				<p>I know our resources are streched thin with the ongoing hostilites
				after that terrible Event, but I request backup in storming that
				illegal H.I.V.E. We can’t win a possible war with enemies lurking
				within our own borders, especially if they are setting up portals.</p></br>

				<p>Signed</p>
				<p>████████</p><hr>

				<p>Ooooone</p>
				<p>The madness of the world forces me to write these lines. Everything
				is gone and no one is here to share my plight. HIS eyes burn in my mind,
				I haven’t found sleep for days. Is someone coming? One of those monsters?!
				No they only live down in that Notch-forsaken H.I.V.E! The lonleyness
				makes me hear things, I always hear the scuttling of those abominable
				roaches who almost ate my face!
				They are coming for me! Both of them. An all I have is a tattered
				H.I.V.E shirt and my trousers. They won’t get them!</p></br>

				<p>Too</p>
				<p>I ate a lizzard. Notch help me! What have I done?! I’m feeling sick,
				green bubbles everywhere. I hear HIM whispering in my dreams. At least
				HE’s gone silent while I’m awake. Time to puke!</p></br>

				<p>March 16th 13 AE</p>
				<p>I had a lot of time to think and get my thoughts straight while I spent
				the last 3 days curled up in some kind of elevated shack, sick with
				food poisoning. I can’t believe I really wrote the last 2 entries, but
				it’s not suprising that I went mad after all I’ve been through. I still
				find myself giggling to myself and I have an uneasy sleep, I prefer to
				stay awake.</p>
				<p>I forgot my name but according to a message left to me, I was an agent
				called “Creeper”.
				I don’t recall much of my last mission but I know that it nearly drove
				me insane.</br>
				I faced pure madness.</br>
				<p>I ran around a place out of this world, on dead bodies strapped in
				machines, tall horrific experiments mercilessly staring at me,
				vanishing into thin air only to reappear behind me.</p>
				<p>And HE was there.</p>
				<p>HIS name is unpronouncable, HIS white eyes staring into my very soul
				and HIS laughter haunting my dreams.
				I’m sorry, I let it get to me again. The “HE” I wrote about is a
				terrifying mixture of man, beast and machine that I don’t even want
				to think about. It chased me around that nightmare for aeons.</p>
				<p>Aeon, what a strange word. 
				I’m getting side tracked again.
				I don’t know how, but I woke up next to what I know was the entrance
				back to this realm of madness. Giant roaches had eaten almost all of
				my clothes and were about to take a bit out of me!
				I ran away, through the confusing installation which I remember to be
				an illegal H.I.V.E. I replaced my ragged clothes with what clothes I
				could find. Finally I found the exit, and next to it a table with a
				note for me. Some superior whom I don’t remember explained to me that
				a war was happening and that they couldn’t search for me anymore.
				There was a clock which broke down shortly thereafter which told me
				the year.</p>
				<p>I invented my own time system based on “The Event” when those crazed
				bunglers at O.I. blew up the Moon. The Moon … HE was responsible for
				that, I now know that. HE told me…</p>
				<p>I have to concentrate.
				Like I wrote: I have a new time system and it’s the 16th of March 13
				years after the Event. I don’t know how so much time could have passed
				after I entered that portal or whatever that demonic device was.
				I’ve ran from the H.I.V.E into the bleak wastes. There definetly had
				been a nuclear war.</p>
				<p>My P.I.M (Personal Inventory Manager), which is the last part of my
				equipment, informs me that my state of health is pretty good considering
				the circumstances. No radiation, no traces of remaining poison, no major
				wounds and after I ate that giant rat (or pig, what know I what it looked
				like before it mutated). I also feel sated and strong.
				Apart from that my situation is looking grim.</p>
				<p>I don’t remeber where I am or who I am. Perhaps I can regain my
				identity by returning to that
				H.I.V.E… Haha just kidding, I’m not that crazy. Or am I?
				Whatever, I need to find food, tools and shelter first, before I develop
				any suicidal plans.
				And I need to find more paper, I’m runni-</p>
