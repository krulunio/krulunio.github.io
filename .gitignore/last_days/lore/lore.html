			<p><span class="name">The following lore uses its own time system. The years
			in the post-apocalyptic “Last Days” universe are measured “before the Event”
			(BE) and “after the Event” (AE), whereat “The Event” refers to the destruction
			of the Moon. The original setting BE was that of a future, as it had been
			predicted in the American 50’s. Atom powered machines and robots anywhere,
			happy children listening to some swell tunes from the radio, while mother
			cooks and father waxes his hair with glue.</span></p>

			<h2>The Mysterious <span class="name">Mr. History</span> and
			<span class="name">Orbital Industries</span></h2>

			<p>The year was 24 BE, a young inventor calling himself <span class="name">
			"Mr. History"</span> was elbows deep in the creation of the world's first
			artificial intelligence. He called it The Huggatron and fancied it man's
			best friend since the dog. The Huggatron was primarily designed for human
			companionship. It came complete with full mobility, voice and emotion
			emulation system, and the means of completing simple tasks at it's possessors
			will. When The Huggatron was nearly complete Mr. History sought council
			with a series of wealthy and powerful men. <p><span class="cite">"Gentlemen"
			</span> said Mr. History, <span class="cite">"I present to you, a machine
			unlike any you have ever seen outside of the cinema. Naturally, I would
			not have asked to speak with you, if I had not something magnificent in my
			possession. With me, I have a device that will change the world as we know
			it. This is a device that will touch the minds and the hearts of people the
			world round. This device will define our voyage into the future. I present
			to you, the world's first Automated Man, The Huggatron!"</span>.</p> Naturally,
			the men were eager to invest, Mr. History quickly gathered a fortune which
			he placed into founding Orbital Industries in 17 BE. Three years later, in
			14BE, he released The Huggatron. As expected, it took the world by storm.
			The Huggatron sold by the millions at a less than economical price. Within
			six months Mr. History was able to pay off all of the investments plus
			interest and protect Orbital Industries autonomy for good.</p>

			<p>Six years, 2 Editions of The Huggatron, and billions in revenue later,
			Orbital Industries announced that in three months it would embark upon a
			voyage to the Moon. Many could not believe that such a thing was possible,
			yet they had not believed in robots either. On October 30th, 8 BE Orbital
			Industries landed on the Moon. The whole world watched as a half dozen men
			planted the Orbital Industries banner at the landing. After the footage of
			the landing was played for the world, Mr. History went on a press trip and
			met with the leaders of all of the world's super powers. He announced
			privately to each of the world leaders that he was, among other things,
			establishing a weapons testing facilities beneath the Moon's surface. Access
			to the facilities would be public, however it would be at considerable
			cost. He told each of the leaders that many of the others had already paid
			in advance for early access to the facilities and they would be left behind
			if they did not get on board. As expected, almost every country forked
			out the money to use the facilities before they were even opened. Using the
			money invested by the governments, Orbital Industries was able to open it's
			first testing center in 8 BE.</p>

			<h2><span class="name">“Golden” age </span> and <span class="name">
			“The Event”</span></h2>

			<p>The next years saw a multiplication in Orbital’s incomes, until it
			exceeded the gross domestic product of any country. This was achieved by
			the sale of weapons to Earth's superpowers, the continued development of
			increasingly sophisticated military and civilian robots, and the increasingly
			important field of waste disposal <span class="name">(ironically, O.I. was
			responsible for most of the waste)</span>. Last but not least, Orbital
			Industries created complexes of underground <span class="name">“Cocoon”
			</span> shelters, concrete and metal reinforced bunkers, that were
			clustered together in <span class="name">“H.I.V.E.s”</span>. Afraid of the
			new weapons the superpoweres had aquired, people payed a fortune to
			reserve spots in the Cocoons. While things on Earth were looking grim
			enough, strip mining of Helium-3 and nuclear weapon tests became commonplace
			on the Moon, turning it into a hollow irradiated dump, often referred to as
			<span class="name">“The Belly”</span>. Although nearly all governments in
			the world started to view Orbital Industries as a threat, Mr. History’s
			safety was ensured by his wealth and superior technology, so they were
			forced to grin and bear it.</p>

			<p>During this time of barley concealed tension, <span class="name">
			“The Event”</span> took place
			and until today it remains a mystery wrapped in riddles, what actually
			happened. It is known that the mysterious disappearance of Mr. History’s
			chief of development, Dr. Hypophysos H. Crocopolous, seriously crippled
			Orbital Industries development capability in 1 BE. A popular theory
			suggested that this indirectly led to <span class="name">“The Event”</span>,
			supposedly caused by
			a poorly conducted and rushed portal experiment to establish a direct
			connection between Earth and the Belly. While the exact happenings on
			the Moon on August 6th 0 AE remain unknown, the resulting chain reaction
			of exploding nuclear weapons and Helium-3 deposits spoke for itself.</p>

			<p>Large chunks of the Moon were blasted away, raining down on Earth,
			hitting cities, causing floodwaves and starting large forest fires. While
			Orbital desperatley tried to contain the damage and avert a PR disaster,
			the world’s superpowers, in a unique display of unity, took control over
			O.I. facilities world wide. On February 2nd 1 AE, Orbital was officially
			disbanded and divided between multiple governments. However, the damage
			had already been done. The pollution of the environment resulted in
			famines and freak thunderstorms all around the world. Contact to the Moon
			and it’s resources had been lost during <span class="name">“The Event”</span>,
			and a general paranoia
			towards science and technology took hold of Earth's population. Mere weeks
			after O.I.’s end, riots errupted in multiple countries, spreading and
			evolving into wars about resources and food. The alliance of convenience
			between Earth’s superpowers crumbled and resulted in a cold war that lasted
			until 3 AE, when the first bombs fell and the world as it was known, ceased
			to exist…</p>
